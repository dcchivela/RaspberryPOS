There is a more detailed install manual at the wiki, if you can use it instead.
There is also a little user guide at the wiki.

To compile and install:

* First make sure you have kde4 installed (kdelibs4, kdebase4, kdepimlibs4) and all of his
  dependencies (qt4...).
  
* The basic instructions are:

  cd lemonpos
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix`
  make
  su
  make install
  
  Now, copy the lemonrc file to your local .kde/share/config directory:
  
  cp lemonpos/src/lemonrc /home/USER/.kde4/share/config/ #Replace USER with your username.
  
* After installation, you need to create a database and user on mysql, to do this:

  cd lemonpos/database_resources
  cat lemon_mysql.sql | mysql -u root -p
  
  
* To start using lemon, type 

  lemon
  
  If for any reason lemon binary is not found, and if your kde4 install path is /opt/kde4 do:
  
  /opt/kde4/bin/lemon
  
 * The default and only user and password is (without quotation marks):
 
   username: "admin"
   password: "linux"

  By default, squeeze has security disabled, this to let you configure squeeze database settings in case
  you have installed the database server at a different computer.
